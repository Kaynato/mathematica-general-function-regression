			Take care to start on the right concavity.
			005 particularly is notable for making it through the concavity issue (though slowly) as the error plot shows also.

Those with 50 data points were in 011.
Combinations of cosine and sine is poor.
Sums of sinusoidal and exponential were poor even with extraction of frequency to aid the initialization.
